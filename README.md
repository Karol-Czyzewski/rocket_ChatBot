## üìÉ About The Project

rocket_ChatBot is a place to look for SpaceX rocket launches.

You can:
- Chcek the info about SpaceX Corporation.

Problem solving:
While working on the project, the main problem was the application of the **SoC** principles.
I kept the Separation of Concerns by separation functionalities for individual classes.
